ergo-emacs-fish-key-bindings
============================

A set of Ergo-Emacs like bindings for the fish shell. (WIP)

Simply put the correpsonding file for your layout in ~/home/{$username}/.config/fish/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish

Fish will prefer it over the system wide default, due to load order preferences

Start a new instance of fish!

Notes:

- this clears keybindings before adding new ones
- Not every binding is done yet
