ergo-emacs-fish-key-bindings
============================

A set of Ergo-Emacs like bindings for the fish shell. (WIP)

Simply put this file in ~/home/{$username}/.config/fish/functions

Fish will prefer it over the actual default.

Start a new instance of fish!

Notes:

- this file clears keybindings before adding new ones
- Not every binding is done yet
